# Determining the speed of computer
In this project, the number of iterations done in 1 second are computed. The concept of multithreading is used.
## Logic
The program notes the time before loop starts and then notes the time inside the loop. When the time difference becomes equal to 1 second, the loop is terminated and number of iterations are printed. 

*Note - pthread library has been used, which is inbuilt into the gcc compiler*
